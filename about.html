        <h2>Hello, Kamusta? (what's up)</h2>
        <p>My name is KT Mina but i'm more commonly known as Pinay Nomad.(For those who don't know the meaning of
            "Pinay",its a slang word for "Filipina".)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Welcome to my travel and <a href="fitness.html">fitness</a> blog! </p>
        <br>
        <p>I started this blog as a creative outlet to share my thoughts,<a href="travel.html">travel
                adventures</a>,fitness inspirations, and love of everything nice.My dream is to make money online and
            throw a dart at a map and travel to wherever it lands.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I know,I know.Easier said than done.Dreams dont work unless you do it. That,s why i left my marketing job and
            focused on being a digital nomad.Being your own boss is great coz you get to choose which 18 hours of the
            day you work. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I love to share my knowledge,travel experiences,and fitness tips in all forms of media!</p>
